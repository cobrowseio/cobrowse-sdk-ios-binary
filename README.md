# Cobrowse.io - iOS Native SDK

Cobrowse.io is 100% free and easy to try out in your own apps. Please see full documentation at [https://docs.cobrowse.io](https://docs.cobrowse.io).

Try our **online demo** at the bottom of our homepage at <https://cobrowse.io/#tryit>.

## Installation

We recommend installing the Cobrowse.io SDK using Cocoapods. Add this to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'CobrowseIO', '~>2'
```

*Don't forget to run `pod repo update` then `pod install` after you've edited your Podfile.*

#### Swift
```swift
import CobrowseIO

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool
{
    CobrowseIO.instance().license = "put your license key here"
    CobrowseIO.instance().start()
    return true
}
```

#### Objective C
```objective-c
@import CobrowseIO;

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*) application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary*) launchOptions
{
    CobrowseIO.instance.license = @"put your license key here";
    [CobrowseIO.instance start];
    return YES;
}
```
*Important: Do this in your `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` implementation to make sure your device shows up in your dashboard right away.*

### Add your License Key

Please register an account and generate your free License Key at <https://cobrowse.io/dashboard/settings>.

This will associate sessions from your mobile app with your Cobrowse account.
